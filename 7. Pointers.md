# Pointers in C++

Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are a powerful feature in C++ that enable dynamic memory management and efficient array manipulation.

## Easy

### Pointer Declaration and Initialization

**Definition:** A pointer is declared using the `*` operator. It is initialized by assigning the address of a variable using the address-of operator `&`.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10;           // Normal variable
    int* p = &a;        // Pointer declaration and initialization

    cout << "Value of a: " << a << endl;          // Output: 10
    cout << "Address of a: " << &a << endl;      // Output: Address of a
    cout << "Value at pointer p: " << *p << endl; // Output: 10
    cout << "Address stored in p: " << p << endl; // Output: Address of a
    return 0;
}
```

### Dereferencing and nullptr

**Definition:** Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value at the memory address the pointer is pointing to using the `*` operator. `nullptr` is a null pointer constant that indicates that the pointer does not point to any valid memory address.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 20;
    int* p = &a;         // Pointer to a

    // Dereferencing
    cout << "Value of a: " << *p << endl; // Output: 20

    // Using nullptr
    int* q = nullptr;   // q is a null pointer

    if (q == nullptr) {
        cout << "q is a null pointer." << endl; // Output: q is a null pointer.
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Pointer Arithmetic

**Definition:** Pointer arithmetic allows you to perform arithmetic operations on pointers. The most common operations are addition and subtraction. When you add an integer to a pointer, it moves to the next memory address of the type that the pointer points to.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int* p = arr;  // Pointer to the first element of the array

    // Accessing array elements using pointer arithmetic
    cout << "First element: " << *p << endl;        // Output: 10
    cout << "Second element: " << *(p + 1) << endl; // Output: 20
    cout << "Third element: " << *(p + 2) << endl;  // Output: 30

    return 0;
}
```

### Passing Pointers to Functions

**Definition:** Pointers can be passed to functions to allow the function to modify the variable's value directly. This is useful for manipulating large data structures without copying them.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function that swaps two integers using pointers
void swap(int* a, int* b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 10;
    cout << "Before swap: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl; // Output: x = 5, y = 10

    swap(&x, &y); // Pass addresses of x and y

    cout << "After swap: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << endl; // Output: x = 10, y = 5
    return 0;
}
```

## Hard

### Double Pointers (int**)

**Definition:** A double pointer is a pointer that points to another pointer. It is often used in dynamic memory allocation or when you want to modify the address of a pointer within a function.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function that allocates memory for an integer and assigns it a value
void allocateMemory(int** ptr) {
    *ptr = new int; // Allocate memory
    **ptr = 42;     // Assign value
}

int main() {
    int* p = nullptr; // Initialize pointer
    allocateMemory(&p); // Pass address of pointer

    cout << "Value at allocated memory: " << *p << endl; // Output: 42

    delete p; // Free allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

### Pointers to Functions

**Definition:** A pointer to a function allows you to store the address of a function and call it indirectly. This is useful for implementing callbacks or event handlers.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to be called
void greet() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Pointer to function
    void (*funcPtr)() = greet; // Store address of greet function

    // Calling the function using the pointer
    funcPtr(); // Output: Hello, World!

    return 0;
}
```

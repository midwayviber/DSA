1. Data Types and Variables:
Primitive Data Types: int, float, double, char, bool
Variable Initialization: Default values, uninitialized variables
Type Modifiers: const, static, signed, unsigned
Type Conversion: Implicit vs explicit casting (e.g., int to float and vice versa)
Scope of Variables: Global, local, static variables
2. I/O Streams and Operators:
Basic I/O: cin, cout, cerr, clog
Operators:
Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
Relational operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical operators: &&, ||, !
Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
Increment/decrement operators: ++, --
Stream manipulators: endl, setw, setprecision
3. Control Statements (If, Switch):
If-else Statements: Syntax, nesting, if-else ladder
Switch Statements: Switch with break, default case, handling different data types
Conditional (Ternary) Operator: condition ? true_value : false_value
4. Loops (For, While):
For Loop: Basic syntax, nested loops, for-each loop (range-based for loop)
While Loop: Conditions, differences between for and while
Do-While Loop: Execution at least once, condition checking at the end
Loop Control: break, continue, and `goto

Got it! I'll break down each topic into easy, medium, and hard levels to give you a clearer picture of what to expect.

1. Data Types and Variables
Easy:

Basic data types: int, float, double, char, bool
Variable declaration and initialization
Scope of variables (local vs global)
Medium:

Type modifiers: signed, unsigned, long, short
Type casting (implicit vs explicit casting)
Constant variables (const) and symbolic constants (#define)
Hard:

Storage classes: static, extern, register
Volatile and mutable qualifiers
2. I/O Streams and Operators
Easy:

Basic I/O operations: cin, cout
Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
Medium:

Relational operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical operators: &&, ||, !
Compound assignment operators: +=, -=, *=, /=
Increment/decrement: ++, --
Hard:

Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
Manipulating stream objects (e.g., using std::setw, std::setprecision)
Overloading stream operators
3. Control Statements (if, switch)
Easy:

Basic if, if-else conditions
Simple switch statements with case and default
Medium:

Nested if-else statements
switch with break and fall-through cases
Ternary operator (? :)

Nested loops
Using break and continue statements
Loops with conditional expressions
Hard:

Infinite loops and loop optimizations
Loop unrolling
Using loops with pointers for dynamic arrays
5. Functions
Easy:

Declaring and defining functions
Function calls and passing arguments by value
Return types of functions
Medium:

Function overloading
Passing arguments by reference
Default parameters
Hard:

Recursion
Inline functions and their implications
Lambda expressions (if covered in your course)
6. Arrays
Easy:

Declaring and initializing arrays
Accessing elements with indexes
Medium:

Multi-dimensional arrays

Pointer arithmetic with arrays
7. Pointers
Easy:

Pointer declaration and initialization

Passing pointers to functions
Hard:

Double pointers (int**)
Pointers to functions
8. Reference Variables
Easy:

Basic reference syntax (int& ref = var)
Passing by reference in functions
Medium:

Reference vs pointer differences
Const references (const int& ref = var)
Hard:

Reference collapsing in templates
9. Basic String Operations
Easy:

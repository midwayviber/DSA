# Control Statements in C++

Control statements are essential in programming as they allow the execution of different parts of code based on certain conditions. Below are the different types of control statements categorized by difficulty.

## Easy

### Basic `if` and `if-else` Conditions
- **`if` Statement**: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
    ```cpp
    if (condition) {
        // code to be executed if condition is true
    }
    ```
  
- **`if-else` Statement**: Executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another if it is false.
    ```cpp
    if (condition) {
        // code if condition is true
    } else {
        // code if condition is false
    }
    ```

### Simple `switch` Statements with Case and Default
- **`switch` Statement**: Allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values, known as `cases`.
    ```cpp
    switch (expression) {
        case value1:
            // code to be executed if expression equals value1
            break;
        case value2:
            // code to be executed if expression equals value2
            break;
        default:
            // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
    }
    ```

## Medium

### Nested `if-else` Statements
- **Nested `if-else`**: An `if` statement inside another `if` statement. Used for multiple conditions.
    ```cpp
    if (condition1) {
        if (condition2) {
            // code if both condition1 and condition2 are true
        } else {
            // code if condition1 is true and condition2 is false
        }
    } else {
        // code if condition1 is false
    }
    ```

### `switch` with Break and Fall-Through Cases
- **Break Statement**: Ends the `switch` statement, preventing fall-through to the next case.
    ```cpp
    switch (expression) {
        case value1:
            // code for value1
            break; // exits switch
        case value2:
            // code for value2
            break; // exits switch
        // Fall-through example
        case value3:
        case value4:
            // code for value3 and value4 (fall-through)
            break;
        default:
            // code if none match
    }
    ```

### Ternary Operator (`?:`)
- **Ternary Operator**: A shorthand for `if-else`. It takes three operands.
    ```cpp
    variable = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
    ```

## Hard

### Conditional Expressions with Multiple Logical Operators
- **Logical Operators**: Combine multiple conditions using `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT).
    ```cpp
    if (condition1 && condition2) {
        // code if both conditions are true
    }
    if (condition1 || condition2) {
        // code if at least one condition is true
    }
    ```

### Complex `switch` Cases with Fall-Through and Multi-Case Labels
- **Complex `switch`**: Utilize fall-through behavior and multiple cases for streamlined handling.
    ```cpp
    switch (expression) {
        case value1:
        case value2:
            // code for value1 and value2
            break;
        case value3:
            // code for value3
            break;
        default:
            // code if none match
    }
    ```

### Efficiency Considerations Between `if-else` and `switch`
- **Efficiency**:
  - `switch` statements can be more efficient than `if-else` chains, especially when dealing with many cases.
  - `if-else` is more flexible and can evaluate complex conditions.
  - Choice between the two often depends on specific use cases and readability of the code.

    ```
    - A) `ref` is uninitialized
    - B) `&` should be removed
    - C) `ref` should be declared as a pointer
    - D) No error
    - **Answer: A**  
      *(Explanation: A reference must be initialized when it is declared.)*

7. **Identify the bug in the following code:**
    ```cpp
    int main() {
        int a = 10;
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            a += i;
        std::cout << a;
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    - A) No error
    - B) The loop condition should be `i <= 10`
    - C) `a` should be initialized as 0
    - D) `std::cout` should be inside the loop
    - **Answer: A**  
      *(Explanation: The code is valid, and `a` accumulates the sum of numbers from 0 to 9.)*

8. **What is wrong in this code?**
    ```cpp
    int main() {
        char c = 'A';
        c++;
        std::cout << c;
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    - A) No error
    - B) Incorrect character increment
    - C) `std::cout` should use a string
    - D) Missing return type for `main()`
    - **Answer: A**  
      *(Explanation: The code correctly increments the character, resulting in 'B'.)*

9. **Find the issue in the following code:**
    ```cpp
    int main() {
        int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};
        for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
            std::cout << arr[i];
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    - A) Array index out of bounds
    - B) No error
    - C) Incorrect loop condition
    - D) `std::cout` is incorrect
    - **Answer: A**  
      *(Explanation: The loop condition `i <= 3` causes an attempt to access an invalid index.)*

10. **What needs to be fixed in this code?**
    ```cpp
    int main() {
        int a = 5, b = 10;
        int sum;
        sum = a + b
        std::cout << "Sum is: " << sum;
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    - A) Missing semicolon after `sum = a + b`
    - B) The `std::cout` statement is incorrect
    - C) No error
    - D) Incorrect data types
    - **Answer: A**  
      *(Explanation: A semicolon is missing at the end of the `sum = a + b` statement.)*

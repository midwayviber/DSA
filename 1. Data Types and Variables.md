### 1. Data Types in C++

Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. In C++, data types are categorized into several types:

#### **Primitive Data Types:**

1. **int**: Represents integer values (whole numbers).
   - Example: `int age = 25;`
2. **float**: Represents floating-point numbers (single precision).
   - Example: `float price = 12.99;`
3. **double**: Represents floating-point numbers (double precision).
   - Example: `double pi = 3.14159;`
4. **char**: Represents a single character.
   - Example: `char grade = 'A';`
5. **bool**: Represents boolean values (`true` or `false`).
   - Example: `bool isPassed = true;`
6. **void**: Represents an absence of value (commonly used with functions).

#### **Derived Data Types:**

1. **Arrays**: A collection of elements of the same type.
2. **Pointers**: Variables that store the address of another variable.
3. **Functions**: Blocks of code that perform a specific task.

#### **User-defined Data Types:**

1. **struct**: Used to define a structure to group variables.
2. **enum**: Used to define a set of named integer constants.
3. **class**: Used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create objects.

---

### **2. Variables in C++**

A variable is a named memory location used to store a value. Variables must be declared with a specific data type before they can be used.

#### **Variable Declaration:**

```cpp
int number;       // Declaration of an integer variable
double salary;    // Declaration of a double variable
char letter;      // Declaration of a char variable
```

#### **Variable Initialization:**

You can also assign an initial value when declaring a variable.

```cpp
int age = 30;
float temperature = 98.6;
char grade = 'B';
```

---

### **3. Constant Variables:**

Variables declared as constants cannot have their values changed.

```cpp
const int MAX = 100;
```

---

### **4. Type Modifiers:**

C++ offers various type modifiers to alter the size or range of data:

1. **signed**: Positive and negative numbers (default for `int`).
2. **unsigned**: Positive numbers only.
3. **short**: Uses less memory.
4. **long**: Uses more memory.

Example:

```cpp
unsigned int score = 250;  // Can store only positive values
long int population = 1000000;  // Stores larger values
```

---

### **5. Type Casting:**

Type casting is converting one data type into another.

- **Implicit casting**: Automatic conversion by the compiler.

  ```cpp
  int a = 10;
  double b = a;  // Implicit conversion from int to double
  ```

- **Explicit casting**: Manual conversion.

  ```cpp
  double num = 7.56;
  int result = (int)num;  // Explicit conversion from double to int
  ```

---

### **Example Problem:**

**Problem 1**: Declare variables of different types and assign values to them.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 21;
    double height = 5.9;
    char initial = 'A';
    bool isStudent = true;

    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
    cout << "Initial: " << initial << endl;
    cout << "Is a student: " << isStudent << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Example Problem 2 (Type Casting)**:

Convert an `int` to `double` and perform division.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 2;
    double result = (double)a / b;  // Explicit type casting

    cout << "Result of division: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Tips and Tricks**:

1. **Choosing Data Types**: 
   - Use `int` for whole numbers and `float/double` for numbers with decimal points.
   - For small-range integers, use `short int`, and for larger-range values, use `long int`.
   - Use `unsigned` for variables that will always store non-negative values.

2. **Always initialize variables**: Uninitialized variables can contain garbage values, which may lead to unexpected results.

3. **Use `const` for constants**: If a value is not supposed to change throughout the program, use `const` to protect it from modification.

4. **Casting carefully**: Always be cautious when casting between data types to avoid precision loss, especially when casting `double` to `int`.

## Answers Table

| Question | Answer                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | Dereferencing a nullptr causes a segmentation fault.         |
| 2        | The output will be 10, as x is assigned the value of y.      |
| 3        | A char type can only store a single character, but '10' is two characters. |
| 4        | Array indices in C++ start at 0, so arr[5] is out of bounds. |
| 5        | Integer division leads to truncation, so x/3 results in 3, which is assigned to y as 3.0f. |
| 6        | In C++, any non-zero value is considered true, so the output will be 1. |
| 7        | arr[3] is out of bounds, leading to undefined behavior.      |
| 8        | There is no issue here; the code is correct.                 |
| 9        | str[10] is out of bounds, causing undefined behavior.        |
| 10       | p is uninitialized and pointing to garbage memory, so dereferencing it results in an error. |
| 11       | b is assigned the value of a before it is incremented, so b is 10, and a becomes 11 afterward. |
| 12       | The division is performed with integers, so 5 / 2 results in 2, and f becomes 2.0. |
| 13       | The behavior is undefined, as the order of evaluation of x++ and ++x is not specified. |
| 14       | arr[2] is not initialized, so accessing it results in undefined behavior. |
| 15       | The 'G' is not a valid hexadecimal digit, causing a compilation error. |
| 16       | The == operator is used for comparison, not assignment. It should be (a == b). |
| 17       | Since both operands are integers, the result is an integer (2), which is then cast to a float (2.0). |
| 18       | You cannot directly assign arrays in C++. Use strcpy or memcpy instead. |
| 19       | p points to memory that has been deallocated, so accessing p[0] results in undefined behavior. |
| 20       | Division by zero causes undefined behavior and usually throws an error. |
| 21       | After delete[], p becomes a dangling pointer, so accessing p[0] is undefined behavior. |
| 22       | After delete[], p points to deallocated memory, so accessing p[2] results in undefined behavior. |
| 23       | Negative indices are not valid for arrays in C++.            |
| 24       | arr[1000] is out of bounds, leading to a segmentation fault. |
| 25       | You cannot delete memory that was not dynamically allocated with new. |
| 26       | You cannot delete[] memory that was not allocated with new[]. |
| 27       | After delete, p becomes a dangling pointer, and dereferencing it results in undefined behavior. |
| 28       | str does not have enough space to store "hello world", leading to a buffer overflow. |
| 29       | Deleting the same pointer twice leads to undefined behavior. |
| 30       | The recursive function does not have a base case for negative values, and large inputs like 100000 cause a stack overflow. |

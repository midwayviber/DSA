1. **What is wrong with this code?**
    ```cpp
    class A {
    public:
        virtual void func() {}

    - B) Slicing problem
    - C) `func` is not virtual
    - D) No error
    - **Answer: B**  
      *(Explanation: Object slicing occurs because `a = b` will copy only the `A` part of `B`.)*

    ```cpp
    int main() {
        int a = 5;
        int *ptr = &a;

9. **What is the problem with this code?**
    ```cpp
    int main() {
        int a = 10;
        int *ptr = &a;
